## General info
Web app created in Django that helps the user examining drilling fluids to choose the right rheological model 
and calculate the most important rheological parameters.

## Technologies
* Python - version 3.7
* Pygame

## Features
List of features ready and TODOs for future development:
* Calculates the most important rheological parameters
* Shows a graf ilustrating the dependence between shear stress and shear rate for given fluid for all main rheological models
* Calculates the parameters for all main rheological models and choose the best model for given fluid

To-do list:
* Improve the interface and layout
* Add a database to store results for fluids
* Optimise the code
* Add English version

## Status
Project finished

## Inspiration
Project created as a part of my masterâ€™s thesis
